Without further requirements you can view the Python - Quickreference via the *[Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ghelatas/python-quickref/blob/master/python_quickref.ipynb)* (you won't be able to execute code here).  
If you want to execute code you can run the Notebook also on *[Binder](https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/ghelatas-python-quickref-37ssypep/notebooks/python_quickref.ipynb)*.

You can find the ipynb-source-file of this Jupyter Notebook here on my GitHub. You will have to download or clone it, then run it in *[Jupyter's](https://jupyter.org/)* Software (Notebook or Lab). First you have to get yourself a *[Python](https://www.python.org)* installation, of course (if not  already installed). If you are going to do Data Science my recommendation is *[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)*. It comes with a Python installation, as well as Jupyter Notebook and Lab and many other features like a handy package manager.
